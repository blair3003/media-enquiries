## App details

The application was developed as a lightweight demonstration of an existing production app used by NHS Forth Valley. The existing application uses a Laravel API with a Vue frontend and contains additional functionality such as in-form child resource creation and related resource lists.

This implementation of the Media Enquiries app contains all the basic functionality including resource creation for Enquiries, Media, Reporters, Categories and Actions. The user interface is designed with Tailwind UI and React components. It also leverages more of the Laravel framework without using an API - web routes and form request validation for example.
